# plugin-elm
SystemJS loader for the Elm programming language.

## Status
Currently, the only elm compilers available are written in haskell.
That means that they don't run so well in the browser.

You can kind of compile elm files server-side with this plugin, but
dependencies are weird.

This project is not going anywhere fast.
